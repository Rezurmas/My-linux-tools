# My-linux-tools
some really usable linux tools i made with claude 

1 - the first tool is for speeding up roblox working on sober i got like 200 fps more from that using gamescope feralgamemode and some graphics and shaders optimazations #sober-beast-setup.sh

2 - second tool is for speeding up flatpak downlaods it uses aria2 and stabilizes downloads now only for poland i setted it up so if you want you cant just change regions in code and the mirros speed will be much faster


if you want to use one of them or change it for your needs feel free to you just nid to downlad the sh file im using for your inforamtion catchy os based on arch :>
