# My-linux-tools
some really usable linux tools i made with claude 

1 - the first tool is for speeding up roblox working on sober i got like 200 fps more from that using gamescope feralgamemode and some graphics and shaders optimazations #sober-beast-setup.sh

2 - second tool is for speeding up flatpak downlaods it uses aria2 and stabilizes downloads now only for poland i setted it up so if you want you cant just change regions in code and the mirros speed will be much faster
